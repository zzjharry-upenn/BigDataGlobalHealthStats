# Big Data in Global Health Statistics

## Introduction

During the pandemic of COVID-19, the importance of health data science has drawn wide attention around the world. We would love to acquire some insights of the global health situation by investigating the health statistics data (HealthStats) around the world.

HealthStats provides key health, nutrition and population statistics gathered from a variety of international sources. Themes include population dynamics, nutrition, reproductive health, health financing, medical resources and usage, immunization, infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, DALY, population projections and lending. HealthStats also includes health, nutrition and population statistics by wealth quintiles.

The dataset we use in our project is the global health statistics dataset from World Bank, containing more than 340 indicators across more than 250 countries or regions around the world.

Our ultimate goal for this project is to predict the global life expectancy at birth using multiple models, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision tree, and random forest.

In addition to this, we also applied KNN for value imputation, cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, K-means for clustering in EDA, PCA for preprocessing, and so on.

In the end, we derived a novel model using ARIMA to get the predicted features, and then fit into the trained models to get final prediction for future global life expectancy.
